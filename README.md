<h1 align="center">Common Use Cases with Prowl</h1>

# Nightclubs 

We've installed Prowlboxes at various venues, but nothing as diverse as a nightclub.

This is so you can see your patrons playlist (once they are connected to your WiFi, they automatically accept the ToS by accepting the ToS. So this is completely fine. 

So there's a couple of things you can do with this data that you capture at a nightclub when you purchase a Prowlbox. 

* Take the data you get, then know what artist to book for your next event.
* Know your demographic better, market in different ways, for more of a population outcome. 

# Coffee Shops 

This is essentially very different from a nightclub, you want to know what people are listening to so you can cater to your customers listening habits by playing stuff over your system when they walk in, they are more inclined to come back to that coffee shop, and set the perfect atmosphere for customer retention. 

# Music Festivals 

The amount of data the Prowlbox would be receiving would be overwhelming, which is why we have a bigger Prowlbox for bigger events, with stronger hardware, usually the Prowlbox can handle up to 500 patrons at a time. When you're talking a music festival you are talking several thousdands, in some cases tens of thousands.
